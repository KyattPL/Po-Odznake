The GOT Route Management System is a database-driven software solution designed to manage and maintain data related to trail segments that qualify for the Górska Odznaka Turystyczna (GOT) – a prestigious mountain hiking badge. The system will provide functionality for authorized users to input, modify, and delete data about trail segments, while offering all users the ability to search and view information on these trail segments.
